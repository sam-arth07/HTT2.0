        title: "History of Sewing",
        data: "Sewing, One of the most ancient textile arts, traces its roots back to the Palaeolithic era. Initially, people in Europe and Asia stitched fur and leather using needles made of bone, antler, or ivory and threads from animal parts like sinew. For millennia, sewing was exclusively a handcraft. The 19th-century introduction of the sewing machine and later computerisation revolutionised the field, leading to mass production. Although, hand sewing remains popular globally for high-quality tailoring, haute couture, and as a form of artistic and creative expression.\n\nThroughout history, different cultures adopted unique sewing techniques. For instance, the Zulu used plant leaves for needles, while the Inuit relied on bones and animal sinews. In Europe, sewing was so esteemed that titles like \"Lord Sewer\" existed. Before the 19th century, sewing skills were especially significant for women, enhancing clothing longevity and being a key part of European brides' trousseaux, which included items like sewing birds and needles.\n\nToday, the importance of sewing in fashion and style is underscored by modern online stitching schools like Stitching class. These platforms highlight sewing's historical significance and adaptability to changing fashion trends."
