						History of Sewing{" "}
					</h2>
					<p className="blog-text mb-3">
						Sewing, One of the most ancient textile arts, traces its
						roots back to the Palaeolithic era. Initially, people in
						Europe and Asia stitched fur and leather using needles
						made of bone, antler, or ivory and threads from animal
						parts like sinew. For millennia, sewing was exclusively
						a handcraft. The 19th-century introduction of the sewing
						machine and later computerisation revolutionised the
						field, leading to mass production. Although, hand sewing
						remains popular globally for high-quality tailoring,
						haute couture, and as a form of artistic and creative
						expression.
					</p>
					<p className="blog-text mb-3">
						Throughout history, different cultures adopted unique
						sewing techniques. For instance, the Zulu used plant
						leaves for needles, while the Inuit relied on bones and
						animal sinews. In Europe, sewing was so esteemed that
						titles like "Lord Sewer" existed. Before the 19th
						century, sewing skills were especially significant for
						women, enhancing clothing longevity and being a key part
						of European brides' trousseaux, which included items
						like sewing birds and needles.
					</p>
					<p className="blog-text">
						Today, the importance of sewing in fashion and style is
						underscored by modern online stitching schools like
						Stitching class. These platforms highlight sewing's
						historical significance and adaptability to changing
						fashion trends.
